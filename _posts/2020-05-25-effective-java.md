title:  Effective Java is the missing book for C++
---

One of my favourite books is ["Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/). I am a Java developer by training who just happen to have landed in infrastructure and systems programming. I am mostly using Modern C++ at this point. It is still my favourite book. It contains 90 guidelines on how to use the Java language well.

My theory is that C++ developers should read effective Java. Thus, the clickbait title. It is the missing book for C++.

A couple of years ago I was leading a team of college new grads. In college, you learn two things: Computer Science and Coding. However, they are not really learning software engineering: How to write software which can stand the test of time. Neither is that a reasonable expectation from a college. CS is the foundation for all of what we write and the cleanest, most maintainable code is useless if the code is wrong or the algorithm is way off.  Back then, I was preparing a reading list for these new C++ engineers. The obvious books were on the reading list like [Effective Modern C++](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do), but also Effective Java.

I will make the case in two steps:

My reasoning is that most tips in Effective Java (EJ), with some imagination, apply also to C++. I will revisit all 90 items of Effective Java and discuss how and if they apply to C++. Some will apply with some modifications, some will not apply at all. I will rate each item on a scale of '1' to '5' with '5' meaning directly applies to C++ with '1' meaning does not apply to C++.

But I go further: Many tips apply to C++ and there is no other comparable guideline document specialized on C++. There are three sources of guidelines I will consider: Effective Modern C++ (EMC), [Effective C++](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321334876?ie=UTF8&tag=aristeia.com-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321334876) (EC) and the [C++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). Effective C++ and Effective Modern C++ are books quite comparable to Effective Java in approach and size.

On the other hand, there are hundreds of Core Guidelines. I personally would wish sometimes that they reflect a bit more on the word “core”. My theory is that most C++ guidelines are so focused on the low-level details like xvalue references that some of the more important high-level discussions do not take place. The quality of the text of guidelines also differs very much. Some have good explanations and examples, why others are only the title and a TODO, e.g. the [CP.201](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rconc-signal).

# Chapter 2: Creating and Destroying Objects

Well, we create objects and destroy objects in C++ and Java. However, we do it in different ways with C++ using the creation on the stack as the default.

In Java, we always use `new`:

```java
List<String> arrayNames = new ArrayList<>();
```

the equivalent code in C++ is one of these depending on the situation:

```cpp
std::vector<string> array_names;
auto array_names = std::make_unique<vector<string>>();
```

### Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

*[5/5]* Factory methods appears to be quite uncommon in C++, but the argumentation applies 100%. With return value optimization, there isn’t even much extra overhead associated with it. Effective Modern C++ doesn't mention factories. Effective C++ mentions factories but doesn't appear to discuss when and why to use them. A subset of what is covered in Item 1 is also covered by [C.50](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-factory). While I do not consider Abseils TotW in this article, it is interesting that [TotW 42](https://abseil.io/tips/42) is a match.

#### Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructors

*[5/5]* In my view, the argument applies 100% for C++. A constructor with many elements is as bad in C++ as it is in Java. Neither the EC or EMC books nor the core guidelines do not talk about the builder pattern.

### Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or enum type

*[3/5]* Avoid singletons and obviously, the enum trick doesn’t work in C++, but if you want a singleton, make the constructor private applies to 100%. [I.3](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-singleton) correctly says “Avoid singletons”, but it doesn’t talk about how to do it if needed.

### Item 4: Enforce non-instantiability with a private constructor

*[1/5]* The usage is actually quite different in Java and C++. In Java, there are a lot of non-instantiable classes like Objects because we need to put static methods on something. C++ still has a lot of classes for which we never expect an instance, but I have never seen the instantiation of such an object to be prohibited. For example, the [std::is_same struct](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_same) can be instantiated. Maybe it would be a good idea to make clearer which classes are supposed to have instances and which are not, but it does not appear to be done.

### Item 5: Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

*[5/5]* Applies to 100%. I cannot find any code guideline about it. At Pure, we have a nice system for this.

### Item 6: Avoid creating unnecessary objects

*[3/5]* Here, we have a tip where the common practice differs materially. Sure, even in C++ you are wary of the unnecessary creation of temporary objects, but in general, this isn’t so much an issue in C++.  Somewhat surprisingly I didn’t find a core guideline tip about temporary objects at all.

There is a reading in which there is more similarity. Unnecessary objects are discouraged because Java allocation and GC overhead they are causing. In some sense, that is true in C++ for heap-allocated objects, which are often overused.

### Item 7: Eliminate obsolete object references

*[2/5]* In C++ we think much more about object lifetimes, so many this is obvious to a C++ developer, but just a couple of weeks ago I had to read the code of a hand-written container class (where 'std::vector' should just have been used) which didn’t call the destructor on clear().

### Item 8: Avoid finalizers and cleaners

*[1/5]* I would give -1 out of 5 if that would be possible. That is exactly what you do in C++ thanks to the clear object lifetime guarantees. Object lifetime is a topic where Java really annoys me. I think core guideline [C.30](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-dtor) is the closed match in the core guideline which proves the opposite.

4 out of 8 tips for Java mostly apply to C++.

# Chapter 3: Methods Common to All Objects

This is interesting as there are no methods in C++ which are common to all objects.
All Java objects inherit from `java.lang.Object`, which has functions like
`equals` and `hashCode`, but also a build-in condition variable/lock with `wait`/`notify`.

### Item 9: Prefer try-with-resources to try-finally

*[4/5]* I want to rephrase that to use "RAII instead of try-finally" for C++. So it kind of applies just in a different (better) way. [R.1](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-raii) is the matching core guideline.

### Item 10: Obey the general contract when overriding equals

*[4/5]* Rephrased for C++ as "Obey the general contract when providing an `==` or `< operator`", this still applies. Even the contracts are the same. [C.160](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ro-conventional) (“Define operators primarily to mimic conventional usage”) is similar, but much less explicit about the requirements. What the contract actually is is not mentioned at all, while Item 10 goes into quite a detail on how to write a good equals method. I actually see a number
of == implementations, which are not really implementing the contract.

### Item 11: Always override hashcode when you override equals

*[4/5]* Again, this needs to be rephrased a bit. If you provide a hash function it better matches the == and < operators. But there is no need in C++ to always provide a hash function just because == or < is available. This is a weirdness of Java. However, thecore guidelines do not mention that == and any hash overload should match up in a certain way. This is an important guideline has it can lead to subtle bugs if `==` and `std::hash` do not match up.

[Abseil's tip 152](https://abseil.io/tips/152) talks about Abseil's approach
on hash code and how to test that the hash code matches `operator==`.

### Item 12: Always override toString()

*[0/5]* The equivalent would to always provide an `operator<<` method, I guess. Nobody does that.

### Item 13: Override clone judiciously

*[0/5]* An interesting difference between Java and C++. The equivalent of `clone` is
the copy/move constructor and assignment operator and they come with ever object unless
you opt-out. In Java, you have to implement the `Clonable` interface. If the interface is implemented, the default implementation of `clone` copies all the field in a shallow copy, which matches C++'s behaviour if e.g. a class contains a `shared_ptr` member, but
it doesn't match for embedded members.

### Item 14: Consider implementing Comparable

*[4/5]* Again rephrased to “Consider implementing < operator”, I think this can stand. The cpp core guidelines talk a lot about the operators, e.g. details like returning *this, but not if and when to implement them.

4 out of 6 tips for Java apply mostly also to C++.

# Chapter 4: Classes and Interfaces

C++ and Java both have classes. C++ doesn't have a concept called
interface, but it has abstract classes.

### Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members.

*[4/5]* Both are true but in different ways. For members, the rules are the same with private and protected. However, C++ doesn’t have private classes as a language construct. However, if a class is an implementation detail consider not putting it into a header file. Core guideline [C.9](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-private) is the closed match.

### Item 16: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields

*[?/5]* I am not even sure what the standard way in C++ here is, but it doesn’t appear to be done as a matter of guidelines. While [C.9](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-private) has a setter and a getter, there is also [C.131](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-get) which explicitly says to not have accessor methods. It would be helpful if the core guidelines would be consistent.

In general, getters and setters are not great class design in Java and C++.
The urge to just expose every field with getters and setters is a remarkable
predicator for more inexperienced Java programmers.

### Item 17: Minimize mutability

*[3/5]* This is an interesting topic. Java tries to share objects references freely, but minimize mutability.

```java
class MyObject {
    private final SomeOtherObject someOtherObject;

    MyObject(SomeOtherObject o) {
        this.someOtherObject = o;
    }
}
```

C++ has a different approach. In C++ we use value semantics and we have mutable objects, but they are not shared references, but independent copies. However, for shared objects making references const when needed is good practice. Making members const when possible is good practice. They solve a similar problem in slightly different ways. There is a complete section of the core guidelines about mutability.

### Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance

*[5/5]* yes, yes, yes. Same arguments. I think this is one of the most important items for Java and C++ in this collection of tips and the cpp core guidelines do not mention it. The closed you get is [C.129](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-kind) "When designing a class hierarchy, distinguish between implementation inheritance and interface inheritance
", but it is not the same. I feel something is missing here in the guidelines for C++. Effective C++'s Item 32 "Make sure public inheritance models 'is-a'" comes very close.

### Item 19: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it

*[4/5]* The arguments still applies to the letter. However, we have to do more work in C++ to prohibit it. We have to mark each virtual function final. You can still subclass, but you can no longer do any damage to it. [C.139](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-final) argues explicitly against this item. I believe in the argument of Effective Java more than in the argument of C.139.

### Item 20: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes

*[2/5]* Clearly, this means something very concrete in Java, while the syntactic difference doesn't exist in C++. [C.129](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-kind), which I already mentioned for Item 18 defines the term interface for C++ and captures essentially this item. Neither the EMC book or nor the EC book capture.

### Item 21: Design interfaces for posterity

*[5/5]* The issue exists in C++. The literal tip mostly applies 1:1. However, the situation is much worse in C++. The ABI is much stricter in C++ than in Java. A jar file containing a class file can be used as long as there is no incompatible change in the method. In C++, the methods are the ABI, but also the fields and other details.
C++ feels it is unable to fix unordered_map or the regular expression engine due to ABI issues. For example, in Java 8 the data structure for collision resolution has been changed from a linked list to a balanced tree (see [link](https://www.nagarro.com/en/blog/post/24/performance-improvement-for-hashmap-in-java-8). That isn't possible without major pain in C++.

### Item 22: Use interfaces only to define types

*[1/5]* Does not apply to C++.

### Item 23: Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes

[2/5] Tagged classes are also bad design in C++. However, class hierarchies mean dynamic dispatching and usually mean dynamic allocation. Both things we are wary about. With `std::variant` we have kind of an alternative tool, while I would argue should be preferred to tagged classes in C++. I can not find a core guideline talking about this topic. Given the design space involving `std::variant` and class hierarchies, a guideline is overdue.

### Item 24: Prefer static member classes over nonstatic

*[1/5]* This is cheating as C++ only has the equivalent of non-static member classes.

### Item 25: Limit source files to a single top-level class

*[1/5]* There are different approaches to physical design in C++. Some people just put a class in a header and have a header and source file with matching names in a lot of ways mirroring the Java approach recommended here. Others don’t do that. Pure certainly doesn’t. The SF section of the core guidelines talk about physical design, but it doesn’t mention this. The Bloomberg guidelines are one of the stricter guidelines on the physical design and they mention a h/cpp file per component, not per class.

4 out of 11 tips mostly apply to C++, too. Considering this chapter was about classes, I was surprised how low the ratio was compared to other sections.

# Chapter 5: Generics

This chapter will mostly not apply to C++ as generics and templates look similar in a first syntactic look, but they are mostly nothing alike.

### Item 26: Don’t use raw types

*[1/5]* However, this is again cheating as this is not possible in C++, to begin with. You cannot construct a vector without providing the type of values in the vector. I have to rant for a second. Generics were introduced into the language in Java 5, 16 years ago. There is no excuse to write raw types.

I guess `std::any` is effectively like raw types. We will if that addition to C++17 will blow up in our faces at some point.

### Item 27: Eliminate unchecked warnings

*[1/5]* This does not apply

### Item 28: Prefer lists to arrays

*[5/5]* This again needs a little rephrasing: "Prefer collection classes to raw arrays". List in Java just means an ordered collection of objects and is not equivalent to `std::list` (which would be `java.lang.LinkedList`). Actually, there is no equivalent to the concept of a collection in C++.

This guideline holds for C++. Surprisingly, the core guidelines don’t mention this. The closed item is [ES.27](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-stack), but it is way less general.

### Item 29: Favor generic types

*[1/5]* Does not apply

### Item 30: Favor generic methods

*[1/5]* Does not apply

### Item 31: use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility

*[1/5]* Does not apply. Interesting concept. Maybe the same thing can be done with lot of [SEINAE](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae).

### Item 32: Combine generics and varargs judiciously

*[0/5]* Does not apply to C++. Varargs in Java is similar to initializer lists in C++. However, varargs are implemented with raw arrays in Java, which do not play well with generics for annoying technical reasons.

### Item 33: Consider typesafe heterogeneous containers

[5/5] The article describes a hacky workaround to std::any. The alternative in the C++ world to an API which just stores a `java.lang.Object` instance with heavy casting would be a `void *` with heavy casting. Casting is frowned upon in both languages. There is no cpp core guideline about when to use `std::any`.

2 out of 8 apply.

# Chapter 6: Enums and Annotations

Enums are much nicer to use in Java than in C++. Oh, I miss Java enums. However, mostly this chapter will not apply to C++ beyond the basics.

### Item 34: Use enums instead of int constants

*[5/5]* True, no discussion. This is covered in Enum.1 of the core guidelines.

### Item 35: Use instance fields instead of ordinals

*[0/5]* Enums don’t have instance fields in C++. We only have the ordinals aka casting an enum to its underlying type. So this guideline does not apply to C++.

### Item 36: use EnumSet instead of bit fields

*[0/5]* C++ doesn’t have the equivalent to EnumSet in the standard. So this doesn’t apply. EnumSet is nice. It is a type safe-way to work with a set of enums. The implementation uses a simple integer when the enum type has less than 64 members and a set for the uncommon case of more than 64 members. People build such a class for themselves with more or less quality.

### Item 37: use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing

*[1/5]* This doesn't apply. We would just use the enum (class) as key of a container because an enum instance is a fully supported object in C++ while an enum in Java is like a primitive type, so the EnumMap workaround is needed. The split into objects and primitive types is the single most annoying issue in Java.

### Item 38: Emulate extensible enums with interfaces

*[5/5]* Enums in C++ and Java have the same issue in that they are not extensible. This tip proposes to use static final objects and subclassing. This also sounds like the right design in C++. I could not find any C++ guideline talking about this topic.

### Item 39: Prefer annotations to naming patterns

*[0/5]* C++ doesn’t have a direct equivalent technology to annotations. C++’s annotations have a similar purpose to Java’s annotations but are hardcoded into the compiler and are not extensible or queryable at runtime. Since there is no runtime reflection in C++, one cannot build 'magic' with naming patterns.

### Item 40: Consistently use the Override annotation

[5/5] In C++, it is not an annotation, but a keyword, but this is still absolutely true. This is covered in core guideline [C.128](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-override).

### Item 41: Use marker interfaces to define types

[2/5] Marker interfaces in Java are actually quite similar to type traits. However, the details differ so much that I can only give 2 out of 5.

3 out of 8 apply.

# Chapter 7: Lambdas and Streams

Java introduced Lambdas in Java 8 (in 2014). C++ introduced Lambdas in C++11.

Streams (also in Java 8) are quite similar to ranges in C++20. However, they also have some overlap with standard algorithms. My knowledge about ranges in C++ is just book (or better YouTube talk knowledge).

In Java you can write:

```java

v.stream().sorted(Collections.reverseOrder()).filter(Helper::isEven).forEach(System.out::println);
```

with the equivalent ranges code being:

```cpp
for (auto const i : v 
                  | rv::reverse 
                  | rv::filter(is_even))
{
   cout << i;
};
```

Java's streams are more powerful than range as they have for example build
in grouping capabilities. And while there are parallel algorithms for the standard
algorithms, AFAIK there are not yet parallelism capabilities for ranges.

### Item 42: Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes

*[4/5]* C++ doesn’t have anonymous classes (mostly), but the rephrasing would be “Prefer lambdas to callable classes”. So, this is true even when the details differ.

### Item 43: Prefer method references to lambdas

*[0/5]* In C++ we have method pointers and method references, but we cannot just use them so easily instead of a lambda. So, this doesn’t apply.

In Java, you can write

```java
String[] stringArray = { "Barbara", "James", "Mary", "John",
    "Patricia", "Robert", "Michael", "Linda" };
Arrays.sort(stringArray, String::compareToIgnoreCase);
```

while you have to write in C++

```cpp
std::sort(begin(v), end(v), [](auto const & a, auto const & b) {
    return boost::iequals(a, b);
}
// std::sort(begin(v), end(v), boost::iequals(a, b); not possible
```

### Item 44: Favor the user of standard functional interfaces

[4/5] This item is about using the standard functional interfaces like `Predicate<T>` instead of having a different type. This doesn’t apply nowadays in C++ as we use a template typename or `std::function<bool(T)>`. However, in C++20 this will start to apply
with concepts, e.g. ['std::predicate'](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts/predicate). I give it a 4 out of 5 because one shouldn't go in and re-invent standard concepts.

### Item 45; use streams judiciously

[4/5] While streams and ranges increase the readability and the level of abstraction. the tip warns that it is possible to overdo a good thing and sometimes a very long stream chain can become hard to read. As far as I can tell, the same is true
for long ranges chains.

### Item 46: Prefer side-effect free functions in streams

[5/5] Again no streams, so this doesn’t apply directly. But it applies to lambdas provided to standard algorithms and ranges. This is especially important with the parallel standard algorithms of C++17.

Do not write:

```cpp
vector<my_type> before_b;
auto i = std::find_if(begin(v), end(v), [&](my_type const & e) {
    before_b.emplace_back(e);
    return e.key == b;
});
```

There is no guideline about the topic.

### Item 47: Prefer Collection to Stream as return type

*[0/5]* Does not apply to C++'s ranges. The output of a ranges chain
will feed into a ranged for loop (aka begin() and end() are available).

### Item 48: Use caution when making streams parallel

[4/5] I will apply this tip to the parallel standard algorithms in C++17. I have used the parallel algorithms because they don't mix well with Pure's threading system, but from all I can tell, this applies.

From all I can tell, there are no core guidelines about the parallel standard algorithms at all.

2 out of 7.

# Chapter 8: Methods

We have methods in C++, so a lot might apply.

### Item 49: Check parameters for validity

*[?/5]* There the C++ practice appears to differ very much. The C++ standard library mostly doesn’t do it and declares a violation undefined behaviour. Pure Storage partially lives by this item. We have various kinds of assertions in our code base. Some only in debug mode, some also in release mode.

### Item 50: Make define copies when needed

*[5/5]* This depends again on the reading. Value semantics are very much about defensive copies. When we return a container from an accessor method, we either return it by const reference or as a copy. This is a topic where C++ has much more elaborate tooling and guidelines than Java has. As in Java everything is a mutable reference by default, this tip is much more important in Java.

### Item 51: Design method signatures carefully

[5/5] yes. Even the details of the tip match to 100%. The tip consists of many smaller guidelines like "Prefer two-element enum to boolean" which makes [Abseil's TotW 94](https://abseil.io/tips/94). While different core guidelines, e.g. [I.23](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-nargs) touch the topic, the coverage isn't nearly as broad as in Effective Java.

### Item 52: Use overloading judiciously

[3/5] Yes. Method overloading is more important to C++’s practice than to Java’s. The general discussion actually applies. The one safe policy for Java is to never have two overloads when they have the same number of arguments. That doesn't appear like C++ to me. So, the arguments actually also apply, but C++ in general makes a slightly different tradeoff here. in C++, we think more in terms of [overload sets](https://abseil.io/tips/148).

### Item 53: use varargs judiciously

*[0/5]* Java varargs sound similar to C’s varargs system that C++ inherited, but it is actually very different. It looks syntactically a lot like variadic templates, but they are like initializer lists.

The tip deals mostly how to enforce at least one parameter in the vararg list, which isn't possibly nicely with initializer list, but would be possible with variadic templates where the type is limited with [enable_if](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if) or static asserts. However, one of that is nice.

### Item 54: return empty collection to arrays, not nulls

*[2/5]* A collection is returned by value in C++ all the time. So this item does not apply. You have to work really hard to design an example in C++, which wouldn't be flagged in review immediately. So, in theory, this applies, but it applies trivially.

### Item 55: Return optionals judiciously

*[3/5]* Optional is very similar to 'std::optional', but it might surprise you. In its argumentation, the tip doesn’t really apply to `std::optional` in any way. I give this 0 of 5. This is surprising, the same name used for the same reason, but the tip doesn't apply.

[Abseil's tip 163](https://abseil.io/tips/163) about optional and why
it is likely not a good idea to use optional to pass parameters to a function and
that the likely best use-case is to return values. This matches the Java guidelines.

Most of the explanation applies to C++. However, not all of it, e.g. the boxed primitive discussion doesn't apply to C++ at all.

### Item 56: Write doc comments for all exposed API elements

[4/5] I don’t know about other people's C++ code, but my impression is that C++ programmers should be much better at documenting invariants and assumptions. Even taking [Hyrum’s law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/) into account. Maybe Hyrum's law in a thing in the C++ world because the separation between the interface and the implementation is so much weaker than in the Java world and the documentation is often worse. People code against an implementation because they don't have a choice.

4 out of 8 apply.

# Chapter 9: General programming

One would assume that most tips about general programming would be applicable. We will see.

### Item 57: Minimize the scope of locals

*[5/5]* Yes. Please do so. Interestingly and especially because C usage is still very different here, I could not find a guideline entry about this. The nearest I could find is [NR.1](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rnr-top), which is sorted under "Non-Rules/Mysts".

### Item 58: Prefer for-each loops to traditional for loops

*[5/5]* C++ calls them ranged-for loops, but even the syntax is identical. So, this applies to C++, maybe with the additional hint that one should consider replacing the ranged for loop with a standard algorithm if applicable. Or ranges.

### Item 59: Know and use the libraries

*[5/5]* The Java standard library is way more extensive than the C++ standard library, but the tip still applies. Item 54 and 55 of Effective C++ cover it as do [SL.1 and SL.2](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-stdlib) of the core guidelines.

### Item 60: Avoid float and double if exact answers are required

*[5/5]* Both languages use IEEE floating-point semantics, so this applies to both languages. Surprisingly, I cannot find a guideline about this.

### Item 61: Prefer primitive types to boxed primitives

*[0/5]* The difference between primitive types and boxed types is one of the worst elements of Java. In C++, thankfully, almost everything is an object (in C++’s sense of an object) and there is no difference.

### Item 62: Avoid strings when other types are more appropriate

*[5/5]* Yeap.

### Item 63: Beware the performance of string concatenation

*[5/5]* We can have a discussion in which language the normal performance of trivial string concatenation is worse. C++ has a slight advantage as we can reserve on a string and update the string in place, but `stringstream` is often a better idea especially when conversions are involved and in Java it is `StringBuilder`.

I cannot find a matching guideline in C++. However, [Abseil TotW/3](https://abseil.io/tips/3) talks about string concatenation.

### Item 64: Refer to objects by their interface

[5/5] Java developers make a much better job in general to specific interfaces and contracts and code against interfaces instead of implementations, but just because C++ often doesn’t do a good job here doesn’t make the tip wrong.

Talking about OOP, my impression is that OOP has been declared too much overhead in C++ and C++ engineers, in general, forgot how to use object-oriented programming even when it is applicable.

### Item 65: Prefer interfaces to reflection

*[1/5]* C++ doesn’t have reflection

### Item 66: use native methods judiciously

*[0/5]* Does not apply to C++. Maybe I can find `extern "C"` functions are the C++ equivalent to native methods, but that would be a stretch.

### Item 67: Optimize judiciously

*[4/5]* While C++ code has higher performance requirements (why otherwise would we use C++ in the first place), there is a lot of premature optimization going in C++ code. When reading the more detailed tips of this article, it mostly applies to C++, too.

### Item 68: Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions

*[1/5]* C++ have not generally accepted naming conventions which one could adhere, too.
C++ developers can't even agree if `const` comes left or right of the decayed type. The right answer is right BTW. The nearest match is [NL.8](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rl-name), which recommends to at least have a consistent naming convention in house.

# Chapter 10: Exceptions

The exception system in Java and C++ works quite differently. And I have to emit that I never in the last 20 years coded in a C++ codebase with used exceptions (not a joke), so my knowledge in this topic is a bit hazy.

### Item 69: use exceptions only for exceptional conditions

*[5/5]* True. [E.3](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Re-errors) recommends "Use exceptions for error handling only".

### Item 70: Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors

*[1/5]* I always liked Java model and I might be the only one. I think a lot of people got it taught incorrectly and in the early days of the Java design (Java 1.0, Java 1.1) a lot of mistakes were made, which never could be corrected anymore. However, this doesn’t apply as C++ doesn’t have the difference. In a sense, all C++ exceptions are equivalent to Java’s runtime exceptions. The last leftover of checked exceptions, the throw exception specification, has been removed in [C++14](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/exception-specifications-throw-cpp?view=vs-2019).

### Item 71: Avoid unnecessary use of checked exceptions

*[0/5]* C++ doesn’t have checked exceptions. Thus, this doesn’t apply.

### Item 72: Favor the use of standard exceptions

*[?/5]* C++ has only a very limited list of [standard exceptions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error). I honestly do not know if this applies to C++ or not. As far as I can tell, there are not standard exceptions in C++.

### Item 73: Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction

[5/5] I assume this also applies to C++. Don't throw a `http_exception` out of your SQL client library when `sql_connection_exception` would be more appropriate. No guideline about the topic.

### Item 74: Document all exceptions thrown by each method

[5/5] I wish C++ would do this. The standard library does, e.g. [std::vector::at](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/at), but who else?

### Item 75: Include failure-capture information in the detail messages

[1/5] As far as I know, this doesn't apply to C++ exceptions.

### Item 76: Strive for failure atomicity

*[5/5]* Complete books (or at [least sections of books](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/xc++.htm)) are written about this in C++ and there are multiple levels of exception safety in C++. It is getting complicated quite quickly in C++ as you have no idea where which exception might be thrown. Item 29 of Effective C++ recommends "Strive for exception safe-code". Surprisingly, there is nothing in the core guidelines about this.

### Item 77: Don’t ignore exceptions

[5/5] Still applies. No guideline about the topic.

# Chapter 11: Concurrency

In C++11, C++ introduced a memory model, which was more or less taken over directly from Java 5 (introduced in 2004).

### Item 78: Synchronize access to shared data

*[4/5]* This is even more important in C++11. Data races are undefined behaviour. [CP.2](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rconc-races) says "Avoid data races". There is nothing in Effective Modern C++ about data races and Effective C++ is not able to talk about data races because C++ didn't know what concurrency is when the book was written.

However, the details are different. C++ doesn’t have synchronized build into the language. Java’s volatile has a very well defined and useful meaning for concurrency in contrast to volatile in C++. So I reduced a point.

### Item 79: Avoid excessive synchronization

*[5/5]* True. Knowing, my performance-obsessed C++ developers, data races are often the bigger problem than excessive locking.

### Item 80: Prefer executors, tasks, and streams to threads

*[1/5]* We are not there yet in C++. Java 1 already had threading support. Java 5 added the executor framework. Java 7 the fork/join framework. Multithreading support in Java is really nice. The standard library support in C++ is still much more rudimentary. I hear executors might make it in [C++23](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/a-short-detour-executors).

### Item 81: Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify

*[1/5]* In Java, each object has a build-in condition variable. What this tip is about is to prefer using higher-level tools like [ConcurrentHashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html) (no equivalent in C++), [BlockingQueue](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html) (no equivalent in C++), [CountDownLatch](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html), and so on instead of the low level wait/notify mechanism. The Java concurrency library is really great.

C++ has mutex and [condition variables](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable) as extra classes as Java has since [Java 5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html) and that is essentially it. C++'s concurrency tools are effectively at the level of Java 1.0.

### Item 82: Documentation thread safety

*[5/5]* I already lamented that C++ engineers should do a better job documenting. This stays true for documenting thread safety.

### Item 83: use lazy initialization judiciously

*[4/5]* Lazy initialization is a bit more important in C++ because static initialization order between translation is undefined while it is defined in Java. However, [constinit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constinit) makes the situation a bit better. In C++, we don’t have to use the double-check idiom. The language does it for us.

### Item 84: Don’t depend on the thread scheduler

[5/5] I have seen too much code which tried to fix concurrency issues by randomly adding sleeps or yields. Just do not depend on the thread scheduler.

# Chapter 12: Serialization

Java’s built-in serialization system is a mess. I expect that no item is applicable.

### Item 85: Prefer alternatives to Java serialization

[0/5] Should be obvious why

### Item 86: Implement Serialization with great caution

[0/5] Does not apply

### Item 87: Consider using  custom serialized form

[0/5] Does not apply

### Item 88: Write readObject methods defensively

[0/5] Does not apply

### Item 89: For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve

[0/5] Does not apply

### Item 90: Consider serialization proxies instead of serialized instances

[0/5] Does not apply

Yes, 0 of 6 apply. Honestly, the framework is so broken, the chapter should be condensed to "Don't use it. Ever".

# Summary

Many tips from Effective Java apply more or less directory to C++ code. There
is only a single instance where a reader would be actively misled by reading
this book about Java (about finalize and RAII).

In addition, many important tips that apply are not covered by the guideline books.
Many are only covered by the core guidelines. However, since the core guidelines
have many hundreds of tips (see [core](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/core)), you need a lot of stamina to actually read throw it. That there is a large overhead with issues mentioned in the core guidelines prove my point that there is a lot over
the similarity between the language.

The short books we can hand to junior engineers and new hires, only cover a small subset
of the items, which apply from Effective Java. I would like to hand them Effective Java
in addition to Effective Modern C++ and Effective C++.
